The "Ola Bike Ride Demand Forecasting" project focuses on predicting demand for Ola bike rides using machine learning techniques. It analyzes historical data and contextual factors like date, time, location, and kilometers traveled to uncover demand patterns. The system leverages models such as regression and time-series forecasting to provide accurate predictions, aiding ride-sharing platforms in optimizing resource allocation, reducing wait times, and enhancing customer satisfaction. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation phases. A user-friendly web interface, built with Python (Flask), HTML, and CSS, allows users to input parameters like date, time, and distance to forecast demand and ride prices dynamically. By harnessing predictive analytics, this system helps improve operational efficiency, driver earnings, and the overall user experience.And the Accurate demand forecasting enables ride-sharing platforms to optimize their resource allocation, reduce wait times, and enhance customer satisfaction while maximizing driver earnings.
